# OverTheWire
This is my journey through the well-known OverTheWire exercises. Iâ€™m taking a hands-on approach, relying on my own skills rather than external aids. My current knowledge of Linux and the terminal has helped me work through much of the Bandit series, and I hope the rest of the challenges will be just as instructive. This is my documentation of that journey. If you notice any errors or have suggestions, feel free to reach out to me.
