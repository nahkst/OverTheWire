# OverTheWire
Hello! This is my journey through the well-known OverTheWire exercises. I am a web developer pivoting into Cyber Security, and here I am documenting my process. Believe it or not, I’m not using AI at all for this, nor am I directly searching for answers. That would completely defeat the purpose of learning. Instead, I research the concepts and figure out the solutions myself.

With my limited knowledge of the Linux terminal, I’ve successfully solved the majority of the Bandit exercises. As I progress, I’m beginning to see what hacking is really about, and it’s fascinating. I initially stepped into the world of programming and development because I enjoy solving problems. Cyber Security seems to be all about that. Combining different facets of knowledge to break or modify how something works. It’s brilliant, and I can’t wait to learn more.

My name is Joshua, and this is my journey.
