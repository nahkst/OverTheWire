# Bandit level 7 - level 8

Grep was the saviour this round. The hint for the level is:

```bash
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth
```

So I did 

```bash
grep "millionth" ./data.txt
```

Lo and behold, there was the password. Displayed right next to the word it found. 

Nice 'n easy.
