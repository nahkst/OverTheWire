# Bandit Level 27 - Level 28

This level is the first use of Git. It's really quite straight forward
if you know how to use git. All you need to do is clone a repo from the URL they give you.

I started off by creating a temporary folder:

```bash
mkdir /tmp/lvl27git; cd /tmp/lvl27git
```

Followed by cloning the repo from: 

`git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit27-git/repo`

Then it was as simple as: 

```bash
cd repo
cat README
```

Wow much difficult.
