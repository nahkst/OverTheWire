This level is really quite straight-forward with knowledge of ssh. All that is required is for you to secure shell into 

`ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`

using the password bandit0.

The password is in plain text in the "readme" text file when you gain access to the machine. 

You discover this by using `ls`. Followed by `cat` to read the contents of the file.

The password for level1 is displayed in plain text.
